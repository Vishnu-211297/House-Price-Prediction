# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using supervised machine learning algorithms and compare model performance based on regression metrics.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Housing dataset containing property features such as size, location, and amenities

## 🧠 Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Built regression models using:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest (RF)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **RMSE of 130.59**
- Achieved **R² value of 0.996**, indicating strong predictive performance

## 📊 Visualization
- Generated analytical plots to interpret model predictions
- Created reports to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- R
- caret
- ggplot2

## ✅ Key Learnings
- Regression model comparison
- Importance of evaluation metrics
- Communicating analytical insights effectively
